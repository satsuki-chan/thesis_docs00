Important notes:

(*) All data in files found_data*.csv, was downloaded with Python 2.7 yahoo-finance 1.2.1 library, which allows the search of stocks and mutual funds information from the Yahoo! Finanas web portal (the Spanish language version of the Yahoo! Finance web portal).

(*) Data in files raw_found_data*.csv comes from the manually earches and downloaded mutual funds from the Yahoo! Finanzas web portal. Due to having ticker symbols different from those officially registered at the CNBV web site, those funds' price series couldn't be automatically donwloaded with the yahoo-finance library.
